This directory contains a mirror of the Angular CDK `BidiModule`. It is included in this package to
avoid a direct dependency on `@angular/cdk`, which may be a burden to users.

This package may/may not be removed in upcoming releases, so users are encouraged not to depend on it
explicitly. If there are any issues encountered with the `BidiModule`, please file them in the
Angular Material [repo](https://github.com/angular/material2/issues).
