Below are the team standards for Flex-Layout Code reviews:

* Before any coding begins on new, large, or breaking work, a design discussion should take place.
* All code changes require a review and approval.
* All behaviors should be covered by unit tests in the same PR.
* Large changes should be accompanied by corresponding e2e tests in the same PR. 
* Authors should attempt to keep PRs to 200 - 300 line changes.
 
## Workflow
1. The code author sends a PR for review. This request should include:
  * A mention of the intended reviewer(s) (e.g., `@thomasburleson`)
  * A high-level description of the change being made.
  * Links to any relevant issues.
  * Screenshots (for visual changes or new additions)
2. Reviews provide comments and the author responds / makes changes. Repeat until LGTM.
3. One or more of the reviewers applies the "LGTM" label.
4. The party responsible for merging PRs will do so.
